# Online-Mobile-Shopping

The project aims to set up a database for managing mobile phone listings, customer details, processing orders, and managing payment transactions efficiently. The system will deliver a properly maintained record with reduced redundancy while increasing the overall efficiency of operations. With normalization techniques applied for optimizing the queries, the database guarantees consistency within the data and quick access to relevant information, making it a vitally important component of an online mobile shopping platform.
